# GoCab
For Developers:
Note:
1. raw_sources is our folder where i put in raw info like dbdesign and etc
2. upload your html pages in GoCab/views 
3. upload css and js files for the html pages in GoCab/public/stylesheets and GoCab/public/javascripts respectively
4. To link your css and js in your html file( present in views) using <link href="path">, please put your path as stylesheets/example.css or javascripts/example.js instead of using relative path to the html file (like ../public/stylesheets/example.css)
5. if unsure on where to upload your html files or anything, just upload them in GoCab/raw_sources and ping me.
